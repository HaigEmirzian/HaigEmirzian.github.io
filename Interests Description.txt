Investing: During my Freshman year of high
school, my interest in investing started
to increase more and more. During the summer
of 2020, I fell into a rabbit hole, 
researching the fundamentals of investing.
Up to today, my knowledge expands from stocks,
bonds, economics, technical anaylsis, 
and even the derivatives market. So much so 
that I founded Tigers in the Money, a club 
educating high schoolers about the 
fundamentals and technicals of the stock 
market. I became passionate about economics
and am open to applying my Cybersecurity 
degree from Stevens Institute of Technology
to the finance sector, particularly DeFi
(Decentralized Finance).

Sus Energy: It was my Geophysical Science
high school teacher who introduced me to Elon
Musk. Showing the Falcon 9 rocket self-land,
the entire class seemed disintereted. However,
I felt inspired to know more about rockets
and their reusable attributes. I then
discovered Tesla, which opened up another 
rabbit hole. I became obsessed with
environmental science and started to learn
the ins and outs of Tesla Inc. I now have a 
deep understanding of the company's
fundamentals, and even their engineering.

Blockchain: During the summer of 2022, I 
clicked on a video on my recommendations page
on YouTube. Little did I know, the video 
from freecodecamp.org about Solidity would 
open up a door to a trending sector in
finance: blockchain. Conceptually, blockchain
seems very applicable to the real world. 
So I began. I developed a simple 
withdraw/deposit system in Solidity and 
tested my code in the Ethereum Virtual Machine
(EVM) via Remix IDE. Whether it be working at a tech
company, or finding one of my own, I will
love nothing more than to contribute to the 
mass utilization of blockchain.
