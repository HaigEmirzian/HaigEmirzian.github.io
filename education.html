			<h1>Cybersecurity</h1>
			<p>
				Technology has exponentially grown, and with that, so has its security. Technology and security have a 
                direct relationship. Cybersecurity is arguably more important, and should exceed the rate of which technology 
                is growing. Whether security is introduced through passwords, firewalls, or hashing, it is vital to carry out these 
                protocols to protect clients from any malicious attacks.
