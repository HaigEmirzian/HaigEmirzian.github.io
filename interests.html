                During my Freshman year of high
                school, my interest in investing started
                to increase more and more. During the summer
                of 2020, I fell into a rabbit hole, 
                researching the fundamentals of investing.
                Up until today, my knowledge expands from stocks,
                bonds, economics, technical anaylsis, 
                and even the derivatives market. So much so 
                that I founded Tigers in the Money, a club 
                educating high schoolers about the 
                fundamentals and technicals of the stock 
                market. I became passionate about economics
                and am open to applying my Cybersecurity 
                degree from Stevens Institute of Technology
                in the finance sector.

                It was my environmental science teacher,
                Ms. Darakjy, who introduced me to Elon
                Musk. Showing the Falcon 9 rocket self-land,
                the entire class seemed disinterested. However,
                I felt inspired to know more about rockets
                and their reusable attributes. I then
                discovered Tesla, which opened up another 
                rabbit hole. I became obsessed with
                environmental science and started to learn
                the ins and outs of Tesla Inc. I now have a 
                deep understanding of the company's
                fundamentals, and even their engineering.

                During the summer of 2022, I 
                clicked on a video on my recommendations page
                on YouTube. Little did I know, the video 
                from freecodecamp.org about Solidity would 
                open up a door to a trending sector in
                finance: blockchain. Conceptually, blockchain
                seems very applicable to the real world; 
                so I began. I developed a simple 
                withdraw/deposit system in Solidity and 
                tested my code in the Ethereum Virtual Machine
                (EVM) via Remix IDE. Whether it be working at a tech
                company, or finding one of my own, I will
                love nothing more than to contribute to the 
                mass utilization of blockchain.
